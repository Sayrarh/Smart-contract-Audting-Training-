# Chapter 12 - Decentralized Application
The term "DApp" is often applied to any smart contract with a web frontend.
A decentralized application (dapp) is a network-based application that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Smart contracts on Ethereum are accessible and transparent, similar to open APIs, so your dapp can even include a smart contract written by someone else.

A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) to make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can get hosted on decentralized storage such as IPFS.

1. <b>Decentralized</b> : Dapps operate on Ethereum, an open public decentralized platform where no one person or group has control
2. <b>Deterministic</b> : Dapps perform the same function irrespective of the environment in which they get executed
3. <b>Turing complete</b> : Dapps can perform any action given the required resources
4. <b>Isolated<b> : Dapps are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract has a bug, it wonâ€™t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network

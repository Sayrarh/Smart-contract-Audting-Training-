### What is Cryptography?
Crypt means "secret"

Graphy in greek means "writing"

According to the above terms definitions of "crypt" and "graphy," Cryptography means "secret writing." It is the act of securing a message so that only the person who is supposed to receive it can process it or conceal meaning from it.

#### Characteristics of Cryptography
1. Authentification : The sender and recipient's identities are verified. A transaction must be sent to the Ethereum network with a digital signature created with the private key corresponding to the Ethereum address in question in order to move funds or interact with smart contracts. 

2. Integrity : a message cannot be modified during the transit between the sender and the intended recipient without any modification to the message being detected.

3. Confidentiality : Only the recipient to whom the message is sent can access it.

4. Non-Repudiation


### Keys and Addresses
As previously stated, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contracts. EOAs acquire ether through the use of digital private keys, Ethereum addresses, and digital signatures. Private keys are central to all user interactions with Ethereum. Account addresses are, in fact, derived directly from private keys: a private key uniquely identifies a single Ethereum address, also known as an account.

Digital signatures, which are also created with the private key, are used to gain access to and control over funds. To be included in the blockchain, Ethereum transactions must have a valid digital signature. Anyone who has a copy of a private key has access to the corresponding account and any ether it contains, so be careful not to lose your private keys. 
The account and funds in it is owned by the holder of a private key.


#### Public Key Cryptography
To secure information, public key cryptography (also known as "asymmetric cryptography") utilizes unique keys.  Ethereum uses public key cryptography to create the public–private key pair. They are considered a "pair" because the public key is derived from the private key.

A digital signature is created using your private key whenever you want to sign a message. 

Message == The details of the transaction in Ethereum transactions.

Because of elliptic curve mathematics, anyone can validate a transaction by ensuring that the digital signature matches the transaction details and the Ethereum address to which access is being requested.

N.B.: The private key is not used in the verification; it remains private.

###### Private Key
A private key is nothing more than a random number. The private key is the foundation of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding Ethereum address, as well as access to contracts that authorize that address. 
The private key is used to generate signatures that are required to spend ether by demonstrating ownership of funds used in a transaction. 
The private key must always be kept secret, because disclosing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the ether and the contracts secured by that private key. 
The private key must also be backed up and safeguarded against accidental loss. If it is lost, it cannot be recovered, and the funds it secures are also lost forever.
The public key and address can then be generated from the private key.


###### Public Keys
Given a private key, you can calculate the public key, but you cannot calculate the private key from the public key.


##### Cryptography Hash Fuction
 Cryptography hash function is the process of converting plain text to human unreadable text known as ciphertext. A cryptographic hash function is a one-way function, meaning for a given value, the fixed length output will always be the same, and you cannot recover the value by decrypting the fixed-length output.

###### Properties of a Cryptographic Hash function
1. Deterministic: A given value will always output the same hash value.
2. One-way function: You cannot get the input value by trying to decrypt the output hash value.
3. Noncorrelation: A slight change in a given value input will change the output hash value significantly.
4. Non-predictable: The hash value should not be predictable.

5. Collision resistance​: It should be hard to find two different passwords that hash to the same enciphered text.


###### Ethereum Addresses
Ethereum addresses are unique identifiers generated by the Keccak-256 one-way hash function from public keys or contracts.
Ethereum addresses are hexadecimal numbers that are derived from the last 20 bytes of the public key's Keccak-256 hash.

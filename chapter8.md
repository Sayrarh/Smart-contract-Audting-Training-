# Chapter 8 - Smart Contracts and Vyper
Vyper is a programming language that allows you to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is intended to be simple, secure, and simple to learn. </br>

Vyper is a high-level language, which allows developers to write programs in a more abstract and intuitive manner, without having to worry about the specifics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on which their code will be executed. </br>

Vyper is a contract-oriented programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine that aims to improve auditability by making it easier for developers to write understandable code. <br>

Vyper is a statically-typed language, which means that all variables have a fixed type that is known at compile time. This can aid in the detection of errors early in the development process, as well as making the code more predictable and easier to reason about. Vyper's syntax is also clean and minimalistic, with an emphasis on readability and simplicity.</br>

One of Vyper's guiding principles is to make it nearly impossible for developers to write deceptive code.


## Here are some of the Key differences between Solidity and Vyper:

1. Syntax: Vyper's syntax is cleaner and more minimalistic than Solidity's, with an emphasis on readability and simplicity. Solidity has a more familiar, C-like syntax that experienced programmers may be more comfortable with.

2. Inheritance: Inheritance in Solidity allows contracts to inherit properties and behavior from other contracts. Vyper does not allow for inheritance.

3. Support: Because Solidity has been around for a longer time and is more widely used, it has a larger and more active developer community, as well as a larger ecosystem of tools and resources. Vyper is still under active development and is regarded as a "beta" language.

4. Compatibility: Vyper contracts are currently incompatible with the Ethereum mainnet and can only be used on test networks. Solidity contracts, on the other hand, are mainnet compatible and can be deployed and used on the Ethereum main network.

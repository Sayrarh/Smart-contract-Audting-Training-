# Chapter 10 - Tokens
Tokens are blockchain-based abstractions that represent assets, currency, or access rights and can be owned by users. Unlike physical tokens, which are often limited in use and not easily exchangeable, blockchain tokens can serve multiple purposes globally and can be traded on global liquid markets. As a result, the association of the word "token" with insignificant value no longer applies.

While digital private currencies are the most common use for tokens, they can also be programmed to represent ownership of a resource, access rights, shareholder equity, voting rights, digital or physical collectibles, digital or legal identities, certifications or attestations, or access to or payment for a service. A single token frequently encompasses multiple functions, and the digital realm enables the separation and independent development of previously commingled functions.


## Token Fungibility
Fungibility refers to the ability to substitute any single unit of a token for another without any difference in its value or function. However, if a token's provenance can be tracked, it is not entirely fungible, as this can lead to blacklisting or whitelisting, reducing its interchangeability. 
</br>
Non-fungible tokens, on the other hand, represent unique tangible or intangible items and are therefore not interchangeable. Examples of non-fungible tokens include tokens representing ownership of a specific painting or digital collectible, each of which is associated with a unique identifier.


## Tokens on Ethereum
Tokens are different from ether in that the Ethereum protocol does not have any built-in knowledge of them. Sending ether is an intrinsic action on the Ethereum platform, but sending or owning tokens is not. The ether balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the protocol level, while the token balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the smart contract level.


## Token Standard
A token standard is a set of rules and guidelines that define how a token should be created and function on a blockchain platform. These standards often specify the technical details of the token, such as its data structure and the functions it can perform, as well as its intended use and any other relevant information. Token standards are designed to promote interoperability and compatibility between different tokens and blockchain platforms, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of use. Some examples of token standards include the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum platform and the BEP-2 standard on the Binance Chain.

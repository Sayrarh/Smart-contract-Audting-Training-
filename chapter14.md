# Chapter 14 - Consensus
Consensus is about being able to arrive at a common state, while maintaining decentralization.
</br>
The term consensus mechanism refers to the entire set of protocols, incentives, and ideas that allow a network of nodes to agree on a blockchain's state.

Ethereum employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which derives its crypto-economic security from a set of rewards and penalties applied to stakers' capital. This incentive structure encourages individual stakeholders to run honest validators, punishes those who don't, and makes attacking the network extremely expensive.
